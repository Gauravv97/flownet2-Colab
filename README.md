# flownet2-Colab
Google Colab notebook for running [Nvidia flownet2-pytorch](https://github.com/NVIDIA/flownet2-pytorch).

## flownet2 doesn't directly work on Google Colab

The simple git clone method doesn't work with flownet2 when running it on Google Colab. Some additional steps are required to make it work. 

[This notebook](https://github.com/Gauravv97/flownet2-Colab/blob/master/Flownet2_Colab.ipynb) along with those changes has some basic tutorials (video to frames, flow visualization , saving flow as images, images to video conversion and warping images using .flo files) to work with the flownet2 model.
